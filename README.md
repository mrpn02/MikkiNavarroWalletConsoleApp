# MikkiNavarroWalletConsoleApp

This is my submission of a wallet console application. I do not have enough time to implement the MSUnit tests with the given deadline. 
To make the solution work the all the schema and SP in the Data folder need to be added into your own SQL SERVER instance.

Also change the connectionString attribute in the appsettings.json file accordingly to match the connection on your own SQL database

<connectionStrings>
		<add name="walletAppDBConnection" connectionString="Data Source=DESKTOP-3T6HMLN;Initial Catalog=ConsoleWallet;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=AppDB;Password=app"/>
</connectionStrings>
